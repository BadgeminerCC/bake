# OCMake
A `Make` reimplementation in Lua, built to automate building softwares on [OpenComputers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/opencomputers)' OpenOS.

# Supported features
- Macros
- Targets

# Installation
To install this on OpenOS, just copy `make.lua` to `/usr/bin/`.
Alternatively, you can unzip this repository into your OpenOS installation, cd into the repository and run `make install` *from within* OpenOS. :wink:

As a side note, the installation process will be more complicated on a real computer and not worth it.
